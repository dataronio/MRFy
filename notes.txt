need to subtract log qx from each emission score! These come from the background probs.

matt first turns the neg-log-probs back into probs

additional probs (from HmmStruct.c line 670+)
bgfreqs: hardcode or look at insert?
X: 1 (no??) 
Z: glx (2 and 11) -- (log of)[ probability of 2 given (match or insert) * probability background 2 + 
                     (same) for 11, / sum of background (2, 11)]
B: same but 3 & 13
U: skip

try: occupiedProb = sum ((m_m + m_i) - i )

transform all transition logprobs to probs

then, occsum = sum for i from 0 to n of ( (len-i) * occprob ) 
			where occprob i = occprob (i-1) * (m_m + m_i) + (1-occprob) * d_m
			
then, for all i, b_m for i = -log(occprob / occsum)
			where occprob i = occprob (i-1) * (m_m + m_i) + (1-occprob) * d_m
			
then, for all i, m_e for i = -log(v)
			where v = m_d + sum
				where sum = sum (i..n) d_d

only have to do this at the beginning for hmms beginning at node 0; at end for those ending at n
