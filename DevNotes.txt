Miscellaneous TODO notes:

- we should add an 'alpha' parameter to Viterbi, and pass in alphabet, since the HMM we pass in is
  now just a list of HmmNodes. This would be useful should we ever wish to handle nucleotide models.

- NMD's viterbi still has messed up syntax, but may be close to working.

- as a performance optimization, we may want to implement a viterbiLite variant which doesn't
  remember the path, just the score. Not sure if this would be significantly faster, but we'd call
  viterbiLite a LOT and we only care about the final path after all the stochastic search is done.
  Question: how could we do this using higher-order functions?

- major work left: figuring out beta-strand stochastic search (uniform dist and psipred-guided).
  Figuring out stopping point and search techniques.

- minor work left: output alignment, compute p-value, read query seq from fasta
