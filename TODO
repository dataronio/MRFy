1. rename SearchGuess to Placement
2. pull [BetaStrand] out of SearchStrategy and capture it in a closure


try

  data Scored a = Scored a Score
  (/+/) :: Score -> Scored a -> Scored a
  x /+/ Scored a y = Scored a (x + y)

  instance Functor Scored where
     fmap f (Scored a x) = Scored (f a) x

  scoremin :: [Scored a] -> Scored a
  scoremax :: [Scored a] -> Scored a


Use fake inheritance in the search strategy modules

Memoize viterbi at top level

quick check

write wrapper functions around indexing and slicing functions

delaying viterbi until BETA scoring reaches some POINT

initial guess Psipred secondary structure prediction
  since we are sensitive to initial conditions

what happens when the query sequence is shorter than the sum of all beta strands

tons of Main cleanup
