To benchmark stuff, you'll need `mrfy-bench`:

  cd path/to/mrfy
  git clone git@github.com:ndaniels/mrfy-bench

To get a short benchmark, make sure `mrfy` is in your `PATH`:

  cd mrfy-bench
  ./mrfy-bench -s

If you happen to be on a branch that supports the `-old-viterbi` flag, then

  ./mrfy-bench -s -old

will run the ICFP version of `viterbi`. Currently, the only branch that
supports this is `three-node-record`.

It is possible that `mk bench-short` and `mk bench-short-old` will do useful
things in the `mrfy` directory. It may not be suitable for those who do not
compile with `cabal install`.
