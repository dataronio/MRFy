{"body":"This is a Haskell implementation of the MRFy algorithm, which applies stochastic search and Markov random fields for remote homology detection in proteins, particularly beta-structural proteins.\r\n\r\nMRFy is still a work in progress, and the scientific results are as-yet unpublished work. We welcome Haskell programmers who are curious about our approach, but we do not yet recommend MRFy for computational biology research, as prediction accuracy is as yet unpublished.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
